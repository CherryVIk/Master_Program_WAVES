This chapter describes the model of the bubble simulation problem and its formulation.  
Bubble's acoustic frequency response can depend on multiple factors. Among them are a bubble radius, water pressure, ensonification frequency.

For the simplicity, in most studies the bubble shape is assumed to be spherical, as the optical equipment at long distances can't provide an accurate estimation of the bubble's shape and size \cite[p.2]{zhang_efficient_2022}. 

\subsection{Bubble flare} 
A continuous column of bubbles with the different radii moving with a different speed within the same direction (???). In laboratory conditions simulation can be performed with the use of the bubble generator connected to the air-compressor. 

\subsection{Target strength} 
It is the measure of the single object's (e.g. bubble) reflection of the transmitted signal. %my words , find justification

\subsection{Scattering cross-section} 

The amount of energy transmitted sound wave being reflected by the small object in the direction of the receiving system is evaluated with a scattering cross-section, the ratio of the total scattered power from the object to incident plane wave intencity \cite[p. 40]{hodges_underwater_2011}:
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{bs}=\frac{W}{I_{inc}}
\end{equation}
We often want to determine exactly how much of an incident acoustic beam's energy is scattered by a bubble, rather than being lost through thermal and viscous dissipation.


\subsection{Resonance frequency of the bubble}
Due to the mass-spring system which appears from the interaction of the incoming wave with a bubble. The gas inside and the surface tension in the bubble with the liquid. 

Often this concept is related to the Minaert frequency and the natural frequency of the bubble. The paper of Ainslie and Leighton \cite[]{ainslie_review_2011} provides an overview on different usages of those terms within multiple papers. In this work the next definition will apply to these terms. 

The natural frequency is referred as $f_{res}=\omega_{res}/2\pi$, where:
\begin{equation}
    \omega_{res}=\frac{1}{R_0}\sqrt[]{\frac{3\gamma P_{liq}}{\rho_{liq}}}
    \label{eqn:minnaert_freq}
\end{equation}
($\gamma$ is a specific heat ratio, 
$R_0$ is radius of the bubble)

The larger bubble radius, the lower frequency resonance

\section{Single bubble model}

Single bubbles can be used as comparison to the fish in the water as they have bludders filled with an air, and this is usually a typical reflective surface recorded with a sonar.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Anderson
    Anderson model provides a modal solution and allows to model the backscattering cross-section of a single bubble for $ka > 1$ \cite{anderson_sound_2005}.

    \item Thuraisingham

    In this paper of Zhang et al. 2022 \cite{zhang_efficient_2022} modal solution is used when ka > 1, and Thuraisingham solution is preferred for the ka<1, as the first doesn't consider the bubble damping effect.  Such approach can be used for our multiple compund bubble simulation.

    \item Church, Medwin,

    Andreeva is for fish.

\end{itemize}

% There is a general formula of the gas bubble's rising velocity based on the bubble's volume, which allows us not to consider the bubble shape and its change during the rising process????(whose citation)
\subsection{Anderson model}
The process of establishing the model for the acoustic frequency response of the bubble dates back to the paper of Anderson in 1950 \cite{anderson_sound_2005}. Initially, the theory of Rayleigh scattering has provided a big input into the scatterers which are comparable to a wavelength. While this work presented spheres with medium-like acoustic properties, and dimensions are as a couple  wavelengths. Using provided calculation we can obtain the pressure and the total energy in the scattered wave.

The following limitation of this model which should be considered is when ka approaches 0. That which means that the radius of sphere becomes less than a wavelength. For the cases when ka <1 or >1 there are no limitations.

This paper results can be used for comparison with other models available nowadays. The implementation in Matlab has allowed us to see how the peak at resonance frequency corresponds to the one of Thuraisingham model. However, at higher frequencies we can observes additional peaks, which indicate other modes of the fluid sphere, when $ka$ is closer or over 1.
% We can express cross-section scattering using a relation of the reflectivity and a measure of the amount of power scatterer diverting from the original wave. That allows to obtain the total 

\subsection{Thuraisingham model}
The scattering cross-section $\sigma_s$ of a single bubble is a ratio of the energy loss averaged over time while being scattered from the bubble to the intensity of incident signal \cite[p.408]{thuraisingham_new_1997}. Thuraisingham formula for the scattering cross-section with the condition of a spherical pulsation of the bubble was presented in this form: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:thuraisingham}
    \sigma_s=\frac{4\pi a^2}{\delta^2 + (\frac{\omega_r^2}{\omega^2}-1)^2}\frac{(\frac{\sin ka}{ka})^2}{1+(ka)^2}
\end{equation}
Where $a$ is a bubble radius, $k$ is a wavenumber in the water, $\delta$ is a damping constant ,$\omega_r$  is the resonance frequency, $\omega$  is the angular frequency.

This model applies over all values of $ka$. After that a model was optimised by Li et al. \cite[]{li_broadband_2020} for the omnidirectional breathing mode. As the impact of the last factor decreases with the increase of the $ka$-value, we require more adaptable model to different modes. In this paper Li et al. have used for $ka << 1$ a Thuraisingham formula and for $ka>1$ was used an adjusted modal solution.

% my plots are better to be placed to the section of "my simulations". Here I propose to insert pictures from papers/books

    \label{fig:thur-anderson}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref*{fig:thur-anderson} shows a plot of the single bubble target strength against  $ka << 1$, and significantly larger values $ka > 1$. The highes peak corresponds to the resonance frequency of the bubble, following smaller peaks of the modal solution might correspond to the normal modes of the bubble, which occur as a resulting oscillations. Yet it doesn't take into account the damping effect present in a bubble.


\section{Multiple bubble model}

For more than one bubble we can add various scenarious for bubbles' location in space, distance between each other, their dimensions, dynamics, and interactions. Those new properties pose more challenges in constructing a valid model for multiple bubbles.

Among the possible real-world applications are gas seapages underwater, bubble curtains which play role of sound attenuators.

% math assumptions and formulations

\subsection{Volume-scattering strength} 
In case we have more than one bubble, where we were describing it with a target strength, the volume backscattering strength should be used instead.
\[s_v = \int\sigma_{bs}n(a)\]
\[S_v = 10\log_{10}(s_v)(dB\;re\;1m^2)\]

% More bubbles are added

\section{Multiple scattering }

Leblond et al. paper states that for multiple discrete bubbles, we can neglect the effect of the multiple scattering \cite[]{leblond_acoustic_2014}. 
\textcolor{red}{Foldy paper equation explanation and concept of the multiple scattering}

When the signal is emitted, the scatterer removes from the wave a specific amount of flux which is equal to the its extintion cross section multiplied by flux per unit area. This amount is partially absorbed and scattered. The next step lies in adding up all the scattering from the received transmitted signal scatterer to other bubbles, then repeating the procedure in the regard of other bubbles, till all scatterers in the close enough vicinity of each other got an interaction with each other.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{multiple-scattering.png}
    \caption*{The scheme of the multiple scattering}
    \label{fig:multiple-scattering}
\end{figure}

But this concept is applicable when amount of scatterers is sufficiently small, otherwise they start interacting with each other and no longer act as a scatter independently. %source????? Foldy or Hazard?

Hazard and Cassier paper provides a mathematical point of view at the multiple scattering with a justification of the Foldy-Lax model. This model help to get an approximation of scattered waves in a deterministic as well as in a random media. Also, local error estimates for circular objects in 2D problem were obtained in the scope of results of this paper.
