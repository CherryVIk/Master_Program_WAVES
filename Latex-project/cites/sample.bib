	abstract = {Recent experimental and theoretical work on the ferromagnetic resonance absorption in unsaturated samples of uniaxial materials containing mutually interacting bubbles is reported. The experiments were carried out on magnetoplumbite platelets 5 to 36 μm thick in the frequency range 16 to 50 GHz with fields both parallel and normal to the easy axis. The originally single absorption line for saturated samples splits into a number of lines the positions of which are practically independent of thickness dependent, however, on the magnetization suggesting magnetostatic modes. Interacting equiphase bubble sublattices precessing in different modes are proposed to explain these bubble mode resonances (BMR).},
