\begin{itemize}
    \item beamforming
    \item cross-correlation, matched filtering
    \item sonar equation
    \item bubble backscattering, natural frequency, Thuraisingham and Anderson models
    \item multiple backscattering
    \item reconstruction filter
    \item sound propagation concepts
\end{itemize}
